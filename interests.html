              There's more to life than work.
              <br>
              There's millions, if not billions who'd say that I'm wrong. You may even be one of them, many the types of demagogue who 
              stand on the "I work 100 hours a week to make it happen and be a x-ionare". Speaking from experience, that's a way to find 
              yourself flirting with a burnout or worse. There's more to life than work, and more to 
              work than grinding to make 7-figures in a bad year. Let me introduce you to the things that drive me at Three Pines Ventures 
              and in life.

              <strong>The Arts:</strong>
              <br>
              To be an effective product developer, it's important to have a solid foundation and appreciation for the arts. 
              As soon as I find myself in a new city, my first goal is to find the best art museums and galleries that I can visit in order
              to gain a better understanding of the place that I have found myself, and the people who call it home.

              <br>
              I spent an embarassing amount of time staying in a small handfull of places in my early adulthood. Because of this, 
              I focus on getting out of whatever town I'm living for at least one if not two weekends a month and experiencing as much 
              of the world as I possibly can, in order to become a more rounded person.

                I don't take the fact that I'm both on the Autism Spectrum and able to effectively communicate the challenges that come with 
                that lightly. It is for that reason that I do what I can both to communicate for others who are on the spectrum who may not 
                be so lucky. As well as to facillitate communication between those who are on the Spectrum, and those who are not to build
                a better world for them.
