              I'm someone who is trying to bridge the gap between my past as an engineer, my passion for healthcare,
              and the future that combines those two fields as one. So let's talk about them some more.

                    <p>
                        Coding is the easiest "hard" skill in the world for some people. <br> <br>
    
                        Thankfully, I'm one of them. However I am admittidly out of practice when it comes to a 
                        lot of basic technologies, and in some ways am more up to date with how to use new tech such as 
                        ChatGPT and VisionOS than I am React/Angular these days. As such, while I may have 4 years of 
                        coding/SE experience to my name, my skills with most of the main technologies are rusty at best. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Where I see my strengths being best used is in Product Management/Technology Strategy rolls, where 
                        I'm coding 25-40% of the time, and developing/implementing use strategies the rest of the time.
                        As opposed to being in direct engineering roles where I would be expected to 
                        be coding 65-90% of the time. Below are the skills I've learned/have used over the years in Technology, 
                        the Medical Sector, and in General. As well as things I want to learn more about and apply to my career
                        moving forward.
